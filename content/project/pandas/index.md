Our project transforms an electric vehicle into a fully autonomous system using LiDAR, cameras, and radar, integrated with ROS. We develop advanced perception, localization, and decision-making algorithms for safe navigation. With sensor fusion and real-time path planning, we aim for a reliable self-driving vehicle to excel in the TEKNOFEST Robotaxi competition.
