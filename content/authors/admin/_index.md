## About Me

Hello! This is Abdullah Enes Doruk. I am a **Master's student in Artificial Intelligence Engineering** at [√ñzyeƒüin University](https://www.ozyegin.edu.tr/en). I am a graduate researcher at the **[Deep VIP Lab](https://labs.ozyegin.edu.tr/deep-vip/)**, focusing on **2D/3D Vision and Deep Learning**. My goal is to develop AI models that can **enhance perception for autonomous vehicles and reduce the gap between different domains**.   

Previously, I worked as a **Perception and Detection Software Engineer at [ADASTEC Corp.](https://www.adastec.com/)**, where I developed AI-driven solutions for **autonomous public transportation**. I also gained experience as an **AI Engineer at [DAIMIA Eng.](https://www.daimia.com/)**, working on **synthetic data-driven AI for robotic systems**.  

I am passionate about **leveraging AI for real-world applications**, particularly in **autonomous systems, and AI-powered perception**. My dream is to contribute to **cutting-edge research and deploy AI-driven technologies** that make a tangible impact.  

Before my graduate studies, I earned my **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bursa Technical University](https://btu.edu.tr/en)**, where I actively participated in **competitions like [TEKNOFEST](https://www.teknofest.org/en/)** and research projects funded by **[T√úBƒ∞TAK](https://tubitak.gov.tr/en)**.
